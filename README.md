# Dublin Pubs - The Impossible Dream

Myself and my brother have a goal to drink in every pub in Dublin. There's a list of all the licensed premises somewhere on the [revenue](https://revenue.ie) website, but my google fu is failing me at the moment so I can't find it. According to [Publin](http://publin.ie/2015/how-many-pubs-are-there-in-dublin/) there's 750 odd. We're about 220 in and this site is gonna keep track of them.
