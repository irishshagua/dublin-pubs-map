53.29520	-6.24657	Uncle Toms Cabin	Nithing wrong with the place but was absolutely empty. Shit atmosphere
53.28938	-6.24340	Dundrum House	Bar seemed alright but lounge was a little too fancy. Too many eating food to be comfortable. Really hot bar girl though
53.28907	-6.24322	The Eagle	Nice down to earth bar and lounge. Darts team in the corner. Decent drink selection... not bad...
53.29505	-6.25695	The Bottle Tower	Shit new age shite hole... fuckin leopard skin chairs and stuff. Cock hole
53.34598	-6.25559	The Long Stone	The drink is fuckin expensive here. Its an old haunt of me aul fella and its close to the dart, so good location, good selection of beers but mug prices.
53.27812	-6.10728	The Daffy Duck	A bit posh looking. Price of a pint was alright though. They showed the football and the bar girl was nice and chatty. Dont get served by the dickhead with the slicked back hairdo
53.27778	-6.10515	The Queens	Snobby foodatorium. Shithole with a retard barman
53.27756	-6.10475	The Kings Inn	Not bad, good crowd, showed the footy. Barman was good. No complaints... Wuda liked to stay longer
53.27708	-6.10324	The Magpie Inn	Nice. Feels closest to a proper pub in the town so far. Bit of a craft bar but nice layout and they have bacon fries... :)
53.27646	-6.10308	Finnegans	Good crowd in the pub. Cuda showed the match on more TVs but seemed a good buzz in the place. Oh and the ridiculously young bargiel had an ass that Kev said he would nuke Tahiti for. I mean.. it was nice like... but it was prob more to do with the fact that she was wearin them skin tight pants which push the ass up. I definitely wouldnt say no meself. But I'd prob need a longer view before I could say whether or not nuking Tahiti was actually justified. Who even knows anyone from Tahiti. Fuck Tahiti. Pretentious cunts...
53.33733	-6.23947	The Schoolhouse	Nice layout and feel to the palce but the bar stuff were fuckin clueless. Kev seemed to like it though.
53.33808	-6.23737	Gasworks	Great selection of craft beer. Bit pricey, but perfect location for a sneaky one on the way to the train station. TBH, I can't actually remember being here with Kev but he swears we were in it. Must've been drunk. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
53.37294	-6.36243	Myos	Hard to judge. Place was empty due to renovations. Certainly plenty of room in the place and the Guinness was alright, so... meh...
53.38400	-6.36770	Bradys	Big generic gastro pub. If you've been in one you've been in them all. Nice tiles on the ceiling I suppose.
53.36261	-6.25894	McGraths	Really impressed. Nice layout, lovely food. They dropped Kevs burger on the ground but fuck it... it was Kevs burger. Good fuckin pub. I'll be back.
53.36359	-6.25801	Quinns	Nice boozer. Local. Barman fuckin hates 12 pubs of Christmas people.... he possibly hates everyone
53.35562	-6.26579	Delahuntys	Grand bar, Darts team playin away. We figured out the 10 Alans who played for Ireland between 2000 and 2017. Hint, there's only 9.
53.35549	-6.26591	Wellington	Good pub, roomy. Pool table... Beer... I don't fuckin know, no obvious cunts anyways
53.355841	-6.26524	Mayes	The jacks are down in an auld WWII bomb shelter... which smells like WWII piss. But it's the official Irish Spurs supporters club pub (and all three of them were even in tonight) so Kev insisted we give it our highest rating ever... 7 thumbs up!
53.355244	-6.26609	Joxer Dalys	Good pub. A bit RA. Proclamations and portraits of Collins all over the gaff but a nice fire down the back. Kev reckons one of the old lads at the bar thought we were cops... :-P
53.230068	-6.12431	Bradys	Nice pub. Plenty of room, racing on the telly. Was early so was a bit quiet and Kev had his under armour on so was sweating balls but no complaints about the place or the price.
53.343316	-6.281042	Agnes Brownes	Real local. Kids in the corner with the bottle of seven up. reminds me of me own youth... How sad... Pint was fine. Lots of pix about the Titanic so maybe the owner has some interest in that.
53.342493	-6.288514	Harkins The Old Harbour	I like it. Nice mix of locals and people working in Guinesses. Big mural across the road about some IRA lad who used to drink there.
53.343532	-6.289117	McCanns Bar	Was in the middle of renovations so was in a bit of a mess. Small place but good buzz. A few in even though it was early.
53.343464	-6.290492	J.K. Stoutmans	Looks like its been recently done up. Tons of photos on the ceiling so you won't be bored when you fall over..
53.342960	-6.290975	The Malth House	Ha, I love this place. Belting out the classics at half 5. Good barmen. Big enough pub as well... Has everything going for it.
53.342405	-6.294543	Kennys	Very big pub. Was a bit quiet when we were there. No issues with the pint or the crisps.
53.342057	-6.252509	The Lincoln Inn	Bit of a snobby crowd but there was a cracker of a burd drinkin a pint of Guinness while the lad she was with had the white wine Chardonay or some shite. Kev fell in love with her and instantly wanted to rescue her from the menstruatin muppet. Plus they had the volume turned up for the match so a decent score for this place.
53.343122	-6.261744	The International Bar	Was alright. Considering the company of pubs in the area, this place is a bit of a safe haven. Had the match on. A few tourists in. Can't really say much beyond that.
53.343131	-6.262119	The Old Stand	Meh. Nice marble bar. Nicely dressed people drinking their nicely presented gins in their nicely expensive glasses. Just too.... nice...
53.342915	-6.261974	Johnny Rushes	Was quiet. Empty really. Hard to get a feel for the place. Barman wasn't a complete knob jockey but they didnt have the match on. Why u no like football....
53.342785	-6.262908	The Rag Trader	Fuckin arsehole barman can't take a joke.
53.342668	-6.262327	Dakota	I think The Rag Trader backs on to this place. They must be the same place. Both shite anyways...
53.343340	-6.264284	The Globe	Didn't really see the place. Met an old friend at the bar and was just yappin to him for a while instead. Seemed alright... No match though. Just play the fuckin amatch...
53.341849	-6.265308	The Long Hall	Small bar. Always busy. Kev didn't like it. I did. If ya can secure a little corner for yourself, it's certainly not the worst.
53.371012	-6.205843	Beachcomber	Big place. Seemed to be the only boozer in the town. Attentive bar staff, racing on the telly, bacon fries and lovely slurpy Guinness.... What's not to like?
53.367197	-6.216601	Harry Byrnes	Another big one. Really cool layout to the bar. Runs along three little snugs.  Large smoking area. A bit too expensive though.
53.367853	-6.227163	Graingers	Nice place. They serve either peas or beans.... So you've a fuck ton of choice.
53.365788	-6.228875	Kavanaghs	Had to play hide and seek with the bar man for a little while but apart from that was grand. Plenty of room. Nice pints and SCAMPI FRIES.... YAY
53.346026	-6.262716	Merchants Arch	What kind of a cunt hole can charge 14 euro for two bottles of piss and keep a straight face. Some poor fuckin tourist got quoted 85 quid for a single measure. Rip off central. Shall not be back...
53.346872	-6.258454	River Bar	Meh... Over the hill hangout. And Kev reckons the barman was the cunt from Doyles
53.347011	-6.258131	Sweetmans	Not a bad bar. Jacks are up 27 flights of stairs which is a bit annoyin and their own Stout is utter piss but the place is grand. Very central so gets a crowd.
53.352690	-6.394000	Hudson	More restaurant than bar. Location does nothing for it. Staff were nice though... Can't see meself being here again unless I'm trying to escape a shopping trip.
53.339533	-6.321399	The Richmond	Kev was a Meh... I was a little less impressed. Trying too much to be a restaurant kills the bar atmosphere. Not great tbh...
