53.28938	-6.24340	Dundrum House	Bar seemed alright but lounge was a little too fancy. Too many eating food to be comfortable. Really hot bar girl though
53.28907	-6.24322	The Eagle	Nice down to earth bar and lounge. Darts team in the corner. Decent drink selection... not bad...
53.29505	-6.25695	The Bottle Tower	Shit new age shite hole... fuckin leopard skin chairs and stuff. Cock hole
53.34598	-6.25559	The Long Stone	The drink is fuckin expensive here. Its an old haunt of me aul fella and its close to the dart, so good location, good selection of beers but mug prices.
53.27812	-6.10728	The Daffy Duck	A bit posh looking. Price of a pint was alright though. They showed the football and the bar girl was nice and chatty. Dont get served by the dickhead with the slicked back hairdo
53.27778	-6.10515	The Queens	Snobby foodatorium. Shithole with a retard barman
53.27756	-6.10475	The Kings Inn	Not bad, good crowd, showed the footy. Barman was good. No complaints... Wuda liked to stay longer
53.27708	-6.10324	The Magpie Inn	Nice. Feels closest to a proper pub in the town so far. Bit of a craft bar but nice layout and they have bacon fries... :)
53.27646	-6.10308	Finnegans	Good crowd in the pub. Cuda showed the match on more TVs but seemed a good buzz in the place. Oh and the ridiculously young bargiel had an ass that Kev said he would nuke Tahiti for. I mean.. it was nice like... but it was prob more to do with the fact that she was wearin them skin tight pants which push the ass up. I definitely wouldnt say no meself. But I'd prob need a longer view before I could say whether or not nuking Tahiti was actually justified. Who even knows anyone from Tahiti. Fuck Tahiti. Pretentious cunts...
53.33733	-6.23947	The Schoolhouse	Nice layout and feel to the palce but the bar stuff were fuckin clueless. Kev seemed to like it though.
53.33808	-6.23737	Gasworks	Great selection of craft beer. Bit pricey, but perfect location for a sneaky one on the way to the train station. TBH, I can't actually remember being here with Kev but he swears we were in it. Must've been drunk. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
53.37294	-6.36243	Myos	Hard to judge. Place was empty due to renovations. Certainly plenty of room in the place and the Guinness was alright, so... meh...
53.38400	-6.36770	Bradys	Big generic gastro pub. If you've been in one you've been in them all. Nice tiles on the ceiling I suppose.
53.36261	-6.25894	McGraths	Really impressed. Nice layout, lovely food. They dropped Kevs burger on the ground but fuck it... it was Kevs burger. Good fuckin pub. I'll be back.
53.36359	-6.25801	Quinns	Nice boozer. Local. Barman fuckin hates 12 pubs of Christmas people.... he possibly hates everyone
53.35562	-6.26579	Delahuntys	Grand bar, Darts team playin away. We figured out the 10 Alans who played for Ireland between 2000 and 2017. Hint, there's only 9.
53.35549	-6.26591	Wellington	Good pub, roomy. Pool table... Beer... I don't fuckin know, no obvious cunts anyways
53.355841	-6.26524	Mayes	The jacks are down in an auld WWII bomb shelter... which smells like WWII piss. But it's the official Irish Spurs supporters club pub (and all three of them were even in tonight) so Kev insisted we give it our highest rating ever... 7 thumbs up!
53.355244	-6.26609	Joxer Dalys	Good pub. A bit RA. Proclamations and portraits of Collins all over the gaff but a nice fire down the back. Kev reckons one of the old lads at the bar thought we were cops... :-P
53.230068	-6.12431	Bradys	Nice pub. Plenty of room, racing on the telly. Was early so was a bit quiet and Kev had his under armour on so was sweating balls but no complaints about the place or the price.
53.343316	-6.281042	Agnes Brownes	Real local. Kids in the corner with the bottle of seven up. reminds me of me own youth... How sad... Pint was fine. Lots of pix about the Titanic so maybe the owner has some interest in that.
53.342493	-6.288514	Harkins The Old Harbour	I like it. Nice mix of locals and people working in Guinesses. Big mural across the road about some IRA lad who used to drink there.
53.343532	-6.289117	McCanns Bar	Was in the middle of renovations so was in a bit of a mess. Small place but good buzz. A few in even though it was early.
53.343464	-6.290492	J.K. Stoutmans	Looks like its been recently done up. Tons of photos on the ceiling so you won't be bored when you fall over..
53.342960	-6.290975	The Malth House	Ha, I love this place. Belting out the classics at half 5. Good barmen. Big enough pub as well... Has everything going for it.
53.342405	-6.294543	Kennys	Very big pub. Was a bit quiet when we were there. No issues with the pint or the crisps.
53.342057	-6.252509	The Lincoln Inn	Bit of a snobby crowd but there was a cracker of a burd drinkin a pint of Guinness while the lad she was with had the white wine Chardonay or some shite. Kev fell in love with her and instantly wanted to rescue her from the menstruatin muppet. Plus they had the volume turned up for the match so a decent score for this place.
53.343122	-6.261744	The International Bar	Was alright. Considering the company of pubs in the area, this place is a bit of a safe haven. Had the match on. A few tourists in. Can't really say much beyond that.
53.343131	-6.262119	The Old Stand	Meh. Nice marble bar. Nicely dressed people drinking their nicely presented gins in their nicely expensive glasses. Just too.... nice...
53.342915	-6.261974	Johnny Rushes	Was quiet. Empty really. Hard to get a feel for the place. Barman wasn't a complete knob jockey but they didnt have the match on. Why u no like football....
53.342785	-6.262908	The Rag Trader	Fuckin arsehole barman can't take a joke.
53.342668	-6.262327	Dakota	I think The Rag Trader backs on to this place. They must be the same place. Both shite anyways...
53.343340	-6.264284	The Globe	Didn't really see the place. Met an old friend at the bar and was just yappin to him for a while instead. Seemed alright... No match though. Just play the fuckin amatch...
53.341849	-6.265308	The Long Hall	Small bar. Always busy. Kev didn't like it. I did. If ya can secure a little corner for yourself, it's certainly not the worst.
53.371012	-6.205843	Beachcomber	Big place. Seemed to be the only boozer in the town. Attentive bar staff, racing on the telly, bacon fries and lovely slurpy Guinness.... What's not to like?
53.367197	-6.216601	Harry Byrnes	Another big one. Really cool layout to the bar. Runs along three little snugs.  Large smoking area. A bit too expensive though.
53.367853	-6.227163	Graingers	Nice place. They serve either peas or beans.... So you've a fuck ton of choice.
53.365788	-6.228875	Kavanaghs	Had to play hide and seek with the bar man for a little while but apart from that was grand. Plenty of room. Nice pints and SCAMPI FRIES.... YAY
53.346026	-6.262716	Merchants Arch	What kind of a cunt hole can charge 14 euro for two bottles of piss and keep a straight face. Some poor fuckin tourist got quoted 85 quid for a single measure. Rip off central. Shall not be back...
53.346872	-6.258454	River Bar	Meh... Over the hill hangout. And Kev reckons the barman was the cunt from Doyles
53.347011	-6.258131	Sweetmans	Not a bad bar. Jacks are up 27 flights of stairs which is a bit annoyin and their own Stout is utter piss but the place is grand. Very central so gets a crowd.
53.339533	-6.321399	The Richmond	Kev was a Meh... I was a little less impressed. Trying too much to be a restaurant kills the bar atmosphere. Not great tbh...
53.340704	-6.310706	The Geln of Aherlow	I can't remember this at all. Kev assures me we did it though. Apparently the smoking ban was optional in there...
53.294701	-6.139319	McKennas	I liked this pub. A few in watching the racing, barman offered to sell me tennis balls. Friendly locals....
53.293926	-6.140055	O'Loughlins	Auld fart bar. Good old country bar look to the place. Jacks are out the back somewhere. Yappy enough punters
53.292989	-6.137471	The Lighthouse	Kev was put off by all the board games. Bit expensive as well. But they had a pic of Phillo behind the bar so some saving grace at least. A little too hipster for the tastes though
53.291780	-6.135145	O'Neills	Wouldnt be a massive fan. Nothing wrong with the place when we were in, it just seemed a little too nice. fancy carpets... fancy lighting... meh
53.290068	-6.130662	McLoughlins	Must be the local celebrity hang out. Saw PJ Gallagher in there. Although the fact that he's Boez Scum has to drag the place down in terms of points. Drink was grand though
53.292478	-6.134219	Hardys	As in Laurel and fuckin Hardy... This one is a bit controversial. First things first, it was a snobbish cunt hole that ya wouldnt feel comfortable drinking in anyways... But the controversial thing is that its basically a hotel bar. And the rules specifically state that hotel bars arent allowed. I wanted very much to exclude this place from the list but I checked the revenue site and apparently they are operating under a pub license, so... (shrug)
53.347958	-6.258063	Lanigans	A regular of the Mammy. Not a bad bar. A load of shite on the walls for decoration and staff are generally friendly but they refused Kev after an Ireland match, so fuck ye. fuck ye in ur fuckin nancy pancy little arses.
53.279509	-6.446417	The Maple Tree	Very friendly staff but smacks off a hotel. Drinks are too expensive and layout is too fancy. A big meh...
53.245715	-6.233533	The Blue Light	Stunning views over Dublin from the many outdoor tables. Seems a good atmosphere in the boozer as well. Liked this place a lot. Although the roads on the way to it are fuckin tiny. Oh and they even had Nobbys Nuts. So extra bonus points.
53.485187	-6.151040	Smyths	Oscar the barman has the best cross Chinese/Dub accent I've ever heard. Also Joe O'Shea wired the place and said they never paid him for it but fuck it at least the pint was nice
53.264647	-6.240209	Lamb Doyles	I'd say the last time this place was done up was sometime in the 70's. Went with the kids to check out The Exploratorium beside it which just left me confused and scared. Food is shite. Bar is pretty good apart from that though. Friendly relaxed feel to the place. Very remote, so prob won't be back.
53.388288	-6.167217	Madigans	Larger than you'd think from the outside. Nice local boozer. There was a one eyed dog asleep on the floor when we got in. Guiness wasn't the best but there was a lad actually working on the taps so that's my bad for going for a fuckin Guinness... 
53.385984	-6.155480	The Foxhound Inn	Like walking down a players tunnel to get into it. Big pub but the Sky box was busted so no racing on... Ended up having to talk to Kev... Ughhhh
53.381192	-6.164922	Cedar Lounge	Good boozer. Friendly locals. They had the Dublin v Kerry game on repeat in the bar...
53.379990	-6.174249	Raheny Inn	Pool hall upstairs if you're bored. Local feel to the place.... Scampi fries... they did have scampi fries... I do likes me scampi fries
53.380493	-6.174902	The Manhattan Beer Co	Ginger Beer and some fuckin bitters addin thing... I dunno what the fuck Kev was drinking tbh. The place is modern and hipstery. Hog heads on the wall and animal hair backed bar stools... Although I'm sure the animal hair is fake. I can't imagine the hipsters would be for killing the poor animals and all that. A bit foody and full of auld ones but sure fuck it.. A pints a pint
53.379881	-6.177264	The Watermill	Yeah good pub. Discout for OAPs which was kinda cool. Although I'm not an OAP. Good barman, good crowd in... decent boozer
53.378408	-6.193521	Horse and Hound	Kev gave me some very solid advice here to not laugh at people when their horse comes last... He's a very wise zen master indeed.
53.349079	-6.257905	Pipers Corner	Chipboard walls. 3 staff on to cater for the 6 people in the bar. More gin than ya cud shake a fist at... All a bit hipstery.. Not bad though
53.348929	-6.259016	Sackville Louge	Small but good. Warm feel to the place. Barman was good and chatty. And there was a lad in swapping door handles for pints... Love that...
53.349503	-6.258027	Briodys	Normal down to earth bar. Nothing special. Barman on was handling the place well. Signed McManamon montage on the wall look kinda cool. More pissers than the DunLeary/Rathdown head office...
53.348624	-6.258838	Madigans	Ok pub. Seemed a bit touristy. This is where things start to go south though. Sure who wants to go see fuckin Bulgaria anyways...
53.348318	-6.259181	Grand Central	Ughhh... Wasn't mad about it. Bit too nice... or whatever. They had lights on the table that when turned upside down electrocuted the heroin addicted barstaff though. So that was kinda fun to play with
53.350227	-6.259351	Madigans	Once Kev wanted a breakfast from Annes... But Annes wasnt open... So he went in here and had a pint instead... Oh the hilarity of it all... Laugh Laugh Laugh.... Seriously though... Shite!
53.350458	-6.259787	Brannigans	Zap wasn't in which was a bit dissapointing but apart from that tis a standard city centre pub. A load of food orders going out which is meh.. but pints and service was generally good...
53.349043	-6.256529	The Silver Penny	A weatherspoons pub. Was hooping when we were there and food and drink are piss cheap. It's hard not to like these places... :shrug:
53.299756	-6.500937	The Gondola	Recently done up so was looking very well. Very large food area out the back but still a well seperated bar at the front. Bar is small enough but had a good atmosphere with a few people in for the match. Seems to be a small bar only area out in the lounge as well which might suit people also. Good parking available here too... Good shout for a Sunday lunch out with the kids or whatever... Kev said the bargirls in the lounge were cracking as well although I was only served by Eamonn... so...
53.362474	-6.486088	The Salmon Leap	Was our first post Covid world pub. To be honest we didn't even know the place was in Dublin until someone highlighted the stupidity of the localized lockdowns being placed along county lines... Cool pub though. They put the effort in to make social distancing possible. Ya can rent a horse box to have ur 9 euro meal and few scoops, which sounds a lot worse than it actually is. After nearly 5 months without a pint in the pub, the Guinness here was possibly the best Guinness I've ever had. Fuckin loved it. Kev only had the one though. He was driving. Aghgghhhahahagahagahagahagahhahahahhahaahhahhahhahahahahaahahaha...
53.587506	-6.188535	The Balrothery Inn	These are strange covid times we're livinig in. So hard to rate a place. First pub we've been to in a year.... Staff were bang on anyways. Only had the one here so not much to say. Layout is grand. Wayyyyy out for us. Only reason we made it here was by bringing the kids out to Ardgillan castle for a trip. Defo not the worst though. 
53.362317	-6.385769	The Strawberry Hall	Impressive outdoor setup. Lots of parking space which is handy as the place is a bit out of the way. Savage views of the underside of the M50 are unique I guess.
53.362486	-6.401808	The Wrens Nest	Beautiful looking bar. Will definitely be back as we had to drink outside due to covid. Quiet bar, good vibes and they did a savage little blueberry cocktail for Kev.
53.350611	-6.255036	The Celt	Gary, the barman, does not give a fuck what you do. Nice pub, good decor, very music oriented. Good mix of tourists and locals as well.
53.346311	-6.261513	Riot	Friendly barman, a little bit hipstery. Lots of deals on shots and stuff like that. Great location but prob geared for a younger crowd than me
53.344608	-6.265803	The Wild Duck	Looks like a hotel bar. Loads of boats hanging out of the ceiling for some reason. Was pretty good though. Kev flip-flopped on the place a bit but the cycling motif in the jacks really upper the tierage.
53.343032	-6.258935	The Portehouse	Bargirl definitely had a thing for me here. In another life it could've been magical. What can I say, the place is a purveryor of porters and lots of other stuff. Great selection but steep prices
53.344626	-6.230806	BrewDog	What a pile of wank this place is. I don't know if it's the fuckin 7.50 pints or the stupid beards and hats. Feels anything like a pub. The beer was watery and shite or else made from the anal drippings of a rare albino tree ferret.... ya know.... just to be cool.... fuckin waste of space.
53.341727	-6.227644	John Clarke & Sons	Decent selection of beers on tap. Great base for a pre lansdowne drink. A little bit on the pricey side but sure blame the fuckin tax on that. Also tried Islands Edge for the first time here, It won't be replacing me Guinness. No salt & vinegar though. WTF is that about?
53.369644	-6.272034	Gravediggers	Have to admit I was a little bit overawed in here. Massive reputation. Of course went with the Guinness and Coddle. Bang on. No complaints. Outside of that, they have a savage little menu. Really want to try the bacon and cabbage spring roll.... If you're reading this, and yer not me, just fuckin go here and do a tour of the Glasnevin cementary and then sink a few Guinness and have some coddle and batch. Fuckin perfect things dont happen often.
53.365231	-6.272124	The Brian Boru	Apart from the savage name it's not a bad little boozer. Not cheap but fuckin where is these days. No complaints. Even if itis in the heart of Boez Scum land.
53.364680	-6.271447	The Berndar Shaw (Part Deux)	Ok let's be honest for a sec. I'm too old for shiholes like this. It's not the beanie hats. It's not the fact that the bar staff are fuckin young enough to play with me kids. It's not even the stupid fuckin disco ball swirling around the bar at fuckin 2 o'clock on a Wednesday. It's just... not a fuckin bar. Let it off to the young wans. Fuck it. I'll resign meself as an unknowing dinosaur in this sense.
53.321290	-6.393518	Quinlans - The Black Lion	Massive pub. was in with the kids for a bit of a lunch. Scampi was bang on. Guinness was nice and slurpy. Hard to rate a place when it's midday but nothing to object about anyways.
53.336108	-6.324064	Rascals	Doesn't really feel like a pub and they've no fuckin crisps but I won't hear a bad word said about the place. They support Pat so I support them with my drunken endeavours. Also the pizza looked nice.
53.324070	-6.326560	The Black Forge Inn	Owned by a scumbag. And they don't have crisps. 
53.324200	-6.325530	Eleanoras	Auld farts feel to the place. I like it. For some reason they didn't seem to want me to pay. Kev said mention that they had very small bags of nuts. But they didnt charge for them anyways, so can't gripe.
53.323880	-6.328460	The Halfway House	Massive place. Modern gastropub feel to the place. Watched the first half of Ireland v Portugal here. Why not at the match you ask? Because every muppet in the country wanted to lick the sweat off Ronaldos balls. Fuck em. Let them at it. I was happy enough drinking instead
53.328680	-6.303320	The gate Bar	Was well oiled by the time I got here so can't remember too much about it. Kev recognised the barman from The Black Lion. Also he was very adamant that the wrong drink was just a mistake. Grand boozer. No complaints.
53.349200	-6.248230	Urban Brewing	Meh. Nice selection of beers and downstairs looks kinda cool but it doesn't really feel like a pub. Nothing bad about it but just not my style.
53.340660	-6.258700	Cafe Insane	Oh god. Do not like. Kev enjoyed the singing. fuck it... its done... i never have to go back
53.344030	-6.263400	Mulligan & Haines	Small bar but seemed popular. Nothing overly memorable about it but nothing wrong with it either
53.345330	-6.264760	The Norseman	Very touristy but the prices weren't ridiculously higher than other places. Maybe everywhere in Dublin is just a rip off anyways. If ya don't mind dodging coked up tourists then it's fine... I guess...
53.239551	-6.196718	Farmer Browns	Fairly standard housing estate type pub. A good few in for Sunday lunch. Lots of staff buzzing around. No complaints though. We were in after doing a little hike in the mountains there. Its a nice area.
53.346460	-6.245680	Dockers	Pretentious overpriced kip. Fuckin 4.50 for nuts. Yis arent fuckin New Yrok. FUck off will ya.
53.344380	-6.238140	The South Strand	Another fuckin Weatherspoons. I really want to hate these places so much. Soul-less. But fuck me they do some perfectly priced drink. Stopped in on the way to a match in Lansdowne and the previous pub, the round was 14, this place the round is 8. Like how can ya argue with that. Even if it is an assembly line hammer blow to real locals... conflicted...
53.332360	-6.27543	57 The Headline	Good chat at the bar. Barman was from Mayo and a punter was a closet Combat 18 fan so plenty of sporty banter. Place looks more like a restaurant than a pub but they have Ambush on tap (which is fuckin heavenly) and good chat == happy punters
53.332170	-6.275410	Leonards Corner	Looks like a good local bar. Was quiet when we were there. Cheaper than its neighbour but nothing massively standoutish about it.
53.330410	-6.275630	MVP	Same owner/operator as Square Ball and very much the same vibe. Barman was a god yap though. He's the first lad to actually ask for a link to the review site, so hello if yer reading. In terms of the place, its a bit pricey and the furniture is a bit poncey. I'm sure we're not their target audience but a decent drink selection on tap, so no complaints.
53.330020	-6.275230	Harold House	Old bar feel to the place. Football was on the TV. No fuckin salt and vinegar though. WTF. Plenty of Dubs licence plates on the wall so say it'd be a good shout for watching a match.
53.389340	-6.123750	The Elphin Bar	Nice bar. Plenty of room. Most importantly though it was open by half 11 on a bank holiday Monday unlike all the kips in Howth... :D
53.344810	-6.252120	Moss Lane	Some expensive-ass whiskey in the place but has a nice feel to it. Little snug in the corner as well. Owner apparently has another place out in Donabate but it wasn't Oscars place...
53.343310	-6.273360	The Beer Market	Standard enough Galway brewhouse type deal. Beers on a chalk board. Lots of wooly hats for no discernable reason. The window at the front of the bar is a savage little view out on the world though. Nice to sink a pint and stare at randos walking by
53.342920	-6.279250	The Clock	Real local bar but the owner is a Pats fan so immediately in the good books. Scarf up behind the bar. Schlurpy pints. No complaints
53.342700	-6.278960	Dudleys	Ambush on tap. Fuck yeah. Bargirl confused Kev though... Another great cross Brazilian/Dublin accent
53.342690	-6.277560	Johns Bar & Haerdashery	We were all set to hate this place. Made up to look like an old shop and then suddenly morphs into a fuckin American diner in the middle and then the jacks at the back. Seems to be putting a lot of effort in to look like something but it wasnt too bad tbh. Good crowd in for pre-gig drinks so the atmosphere was alright
53.342740	-6.277250	Tom Kennedys	Standard enough place. Some world class Darts lads warming up. Or maybe they were shit. Da Fuck do I know about Darts. Another one that gets a bit of atmosphere from pre gig crowds so there's an interesting mix in the place
53.375850	-6.332040	The Lock Keeper	Nice location alongside the canal. Nice food and reasonably priced. 
53.347850	-6.258580	Meaghers	Tis a magical wonderous place where bartenders use some kind of vulcan mind meld power to guess what crisps you secretly desire most and your first round is always free. We were even joined by two Mexican lads Francisco and Alvaro. Unfortunately they forgot to bring the Tortillas... much sadness...
53.345810	-6.257880	Bowes	So lets be clear from the get go. It may be owned by the same owner as a certain kip hole cunt place.... BUT ITS A DIFFERENT BAR. Dodgey gray area sure. Bar is nice though. Francis joined us for a pint but he was a little bit scared of all the old women wandering around stealing glasses. Still... Pints were schlurpy
53.357250	-6.248940	Bridge Tavern	Brilliant Dubs mural means ya can spot this place from a mile away. Tunes from the flats were blasting and the place was hopping before the Dubs Kerry game. Fast bar service, brilliant weather. Had a good time here...
53.347411	-6.424008	Penny Hill	Big roomy middle estate style pub. Things to like and dislike so could go either way. Was busy when we were there, was a cracking day so lots sitting outside for food. Plenty of staff on and the bar staff seemed decent but one of the lounge boys knicked me change... 🤣. Not the usual style of bar I like but nothing seriously wrong with it tbh
53.344773	-6.398057	The Finches	Bit of a kip this tbh. Nothing wrong with the place just old and mostly unmaintained. Atmosphere iside was grand. Its big and roomy but stick some new fuckin padding in the couches
53.352830	-6.394310	Hudson Shithole	I really wanted to exclude this place from the list in the hope that it was a restaraunt licence or something but I was too lazy to check. Fuckin wank stain of a place anyways. Avoid.
53.381050	-6.245560	The Viscount	The bar appears to be named after a plane which crashed while flying from Cork to London in the 60s. Was quiet when we were here but the decor was pretty cool. No complaints. Seems a good local.
53.459350	-6.220760	The Pound & The Attic	First bar that we did in Swords and tbh, we peaked early. Prob the best boozer in the town. Barman was very friendly, helped us plan the route for the rest of the pubs. Bar was a nice feel. Would defo return.
53.456780	-6.223000	The Old Schoolhouse	Absolutely massive place. Completely devoid of any kind of atmosphere though. No charger behind the bar either... and there probably was a charger behind the bar. Also, why fuckin play CHristmas songs over the football commentary. Not a fan.
53.456430	-6.222040	The Old Borough	Nearly didnt do this place as we thought it was a hotel but a quick scan of the revenue site confirmed they have a 7 day pub licence so it counts. Yes its a Widdershins but tbh it's better than the Schoolhouse place behind it. Also 20 quid for two dinners and two pints, can't fuckin argue with that. And the barman gave me a charger for the phone as well. No complaints
53.456220	-6.220680	Wrights Cafe Bar	Got a bang of auld lad trying to pick up young wans from this place. Seems to be disco bar style. Not a massive fan but nice beers on tap at least.
53.458640	-6.220160	The Arch Bar	Not a bad bar. Good staff, plenty of viewing angles for the TV but still places to hide away from the TV. Decent crowd in for a Tuesday. Would use the place again for a bit of food but very big so doesnt have that cozy bar feel.
53.457900	-6.220570	The Cock Tavern	It's like a seven mile trek from the front bar down to the jacks. Maybe third best pub in the town. Nothing against it though. Except the fact they don't have salt & vinegar crips. WTF. Anyways, beer was nice.
53.365830	-6.322940	Hole In The Wall	Popped in for a quick pint in the Presidents snug after bursting James' nose open with an over-zealous challenge in the Phoenix Park. Crisps and coke solve all woes though. Great bit of history in the place. Would have loved to stay for another few.
53.363250	-6.235670	Bru House	Same as all the Galway Bay pubs, there's a great selection of beers but the prices are definitely steep. Nice feel to the place though, not too hipster. Nice old library in one of the corners. Fairview park across the road is great for a play as well so the pub works well after you've built up a thirst.
53.363000	-6.236510	Gaffneys	Great little snug at the front of the bar. Nice classic feel to the place. Liked this place, would defo be back. Close enough to let the kids play in the park as well... :D
53.316500	-6.332980	Cherrytree	Exciting enough visit with Spurs going 5 nil down to Newcastle inside 20 mins. But the free pastries perked Kev back up a bit. Nice pub. Plenty of space and a good local feel. 
53.317400	-6.332260	Kestrel	Very large and was full of people getting their carvery on while we were there. Wouldnt be a massive fan. Nearly too large to feel like a proper pub but no major complaints against it.
53.275340	-6.354600	The Old Mill	We were doing a couple pubs and I was driving so switched onto a zero after a bottle. Barman looked absolutely disgusted with me. TBH that's prob a plus point for the place. Nice local feel. Nothing against it
53.277900	-6.358440	Ahernes	Nice roomy bar. Plenty of room in the place and a good smattering of TVs. Kev was mucho impressed with the lemony scent in the jacks. He's an odd fuck though.
53.359780	-6.25697	The Hideout	Savage location for the bar, tucked away in a tiny little housing estate just around the corner from Croker. Got in for a quick pint before the Kilkenny v Clare semi final. Friendly staff, bit of banter, great location.... 3 thumbs up.
53.358390	-6.255940	Ryans Hogan Stand	Gets a decent crowd in on a match day. Does be absolutely wedged. Staff still churn out the pints though. Always a joy to watch quality bar staff in action
53.296470	-6.211440	Kennedys	Brought Emma and Jenny here for some grub after a camogie blitz in UCD. Fuck me the place was expensive. Nothing wrong with apart. The food was nice, the staff were nice, the beer was fine.... Just the prices in pubs now if feckin mental
53.288340	-6.204690	The Millhouse	Was a flying visit. Hard to rate. Fuckin expensive. But sure every fuckin place seems to be expensive now. Plenty of staff. Quick service. No real complaints. Just.... expensive
53.281150	-6.477030	An Poitin Stil	Lots of old antique stuff and a well run bar. Gets a good crowd in and they have people managing parking etc. Prob an interesting spot to show off to people. Can't imagine that it'd ever feel like a regular to me.
53.346670	-6.258850	Pillar Bar	Decent tunes in the place. Good selection of beers. Bit expensive but ya can't really get more central with the location. Not really a bar feel. More disco bar / lounge type deal but nothing wrong with the place I suppose. Barman had very shakey hands.
53.346370	-6.258850	Cassidys	Real Berlin style grunge bar look. Meanies and burger buns crisps. Not fuckin bad. Barman had hair like the dude from Static-X as well. Cool bar. Daycent beers.
53.350330	-6.258410	The Confession Box	Tiny little bar. real mix of locals and blow ins. Lovely slurpy Guinness. I likes it
53.341260	-6.261000	McDaids	Able to spy on the fancy lookin cars parking up in the Westbury. Pub is grand, the trek to jacks can be lethal if you've had a few. Honest clientelle though, left me laptop here after a drink and only realised two pubs later and it was still there. Bonus points for that
53.340760	-6.261230	Nearys	All the barmen are wearing fancy dicky bos. And Kev spotted Bo Martin at the bar. Who's Bo Martin you ask? Shane Lowrys ex caddy. Why ex? Fuck knows, apparently Lowry is a bit of a prick with the caddies. Sure what do I know. Pub is grand anyways. Did I mention they wear dicky bos?
53.340960	-6.261800	Sheehans	They've a wall of whiskey bottles locked behind little doors. Reminded me of that second wizard of oz film where yer one had a lot of heads locked in little cabinets. Anyways pub was fine. Upstairs is more restauranty but no complaints.
53.339640	-6.265650	Swan Bar	Has a statue of some Rugger Bugger in the corner. Bar was grand. Nice old wooden bar. No complaints but nothing standoutish
53.337510	-6.265940	The Landmark	Had a few tunes going and the bar sang happy birthday to some lad and he was scarlet. Also took me way longer than it should have to find the jacks. No complaints though, nice bar.
53.336570	-6.265660	Whelans	Went to see a Pat McManus gig here... but there was no Pat McManus... Where the fuck was Pat McManus????
53.336380	-6.265700	Ryans	Fuck me I'm old...
53.350750	-6.244860	Noctors	Lovely auld one behind the bar. Real local place. First time in a long time that I've been in a Dublin pub that was cash only. Friendly locals though and reasonably priced pint. The Guinness was fuckin top notch too.
53.338910	-6.272340	The Fourth Corner	Hipstery type place. Decent selection of beers but doesn't have that homely pub feel to the place
53.338980	-6.273400	Fallons (The Capstan)	I like it. Good classic bar feel. Was busy enough. Ling used to live in the area and its near the best named Guitar shop ever. What's not to like
53.337240	-6.275240	Tenters	A bit meh. Felt like a hotel lobby. It did have a cool old map of DUblin on the wall. I liked that. Also the barman ran out after me when I fogot me cap so nice peoples. Just the atmosphere was a bit meh. They seemed to have take home dinners though which was kinda novel
53.341550	-6.274830	The Liberty Belle	Nice local pub feel to the place. I don't really remember it well tbh. Guinness was taking it's toll at this stage
53.341540	-6.278610	Luckys	More of a restaurant feel than a bar. But sure fuck it, its done now
53.287000	-6.123150	The Greedy Eagle	Nothing particularly against the place. It's an expensive part of Dublin, so was prepared for the prices. Its big and roomy. It just doesn't have a pub vibe tbh. More restauranty. No complaints though. Had a pint. The darts were on. Grand place.
53.286000	-6.118640	Fitzgeralds	If I ever win the lotto and move to this part of Dublin, this would prob be me local. I liked it. Decent selection of pints on tap. Good bar feel. Also, the jacks handle are made out of old pennies which was pretty cool. Not a bad pub.
53.289780	-6.130080	Walters	What an absolute waste of space. Staff were shite, couldn't pull a pint to save their lives and absolutely reeked of lack of interest. Decor was crap. Clientelle was boring. Just a really shit pub. Only reason we stayed in the kip so long was because it took so long to get served. It wasn't even fuckin busy. Useless kip.
53.294780	-6.141640	Buck Mulligans	It's a weird fuckin layout. They've stupid fuckin low tables in the middle of the walkways. Big sofa style chairs. Only one person in the jacks at a time. Just weird. Prob be a decent boozer with a better interior design. But meh.... Seems to be one for the hipsters
53.295200	-6.148070	The Purty Kitchen	They had a staff to customer ratio of about 27 to 1 and there was like 20 customers in. But apart from that, it was fine. Introduced Kev to yellow spot. No complaints though. Grand pub.
53.276430	-6.249150	The Coach House Pub	Lovely ornate interior. A library wall is actually a great idea and something I'd love to see more of. It's an expensive area, so ya pay for it but definitely one of the more impressive look & feels to a pub
53.274730	-6.254470	Ballinteer House	Big modern gastro pub feel for it. No great enjoyment off the interior and not exactly cheap. Nothing particularly against the place but most likely will never frequent it.
53.566590	-6.383940	Gormleys Pub	Lovely rustic local. Raging fire in the corner. Quiet day time drink. Only a few lads and the racing. If I was living in the middle of fuckin no-where, this is the type of pub I'd want as me local.
53.433130	-6.332530	The Brock Inn	Was there with the kids so was in the lounge for food. Lovely grub. Busy place, does a good trade. There's a pnp course beside it which me Da loves and it's right in the path for Dublin airport so nice for any airplane spotters.
53.350370	-6.281680	Walshs	Great pub. Was heaving on a Saturday evening. Has a cool little front bar as well. Also.... Spicy Nuts... Fuck Yeah
53.350380	-6.282050	The Belfry	Slightly weird American cocktail bar feel to the place but it's not too bad. Decent 70s playlist on and the Guinness was fine. Was starting to grow on Kev by the end
53.350830	-6.282020	The Glimmer Man	One of the few pubs in Dublin that's cash only. I guess it's a hipster thing. There wasn't a fuckin inch of wall space that didnt have some poster or milk float or suitcase. Just seemed to be random. Not sure what effect they were going for. Also.... The Guinness was shite. Watery. Just badly pured tbh. There was a good crowd in though
53.351000	-6.282270	Mulligans	Hipster bar. Big fuckin beard on the Cark barman, Locally produced ales, People sitting at the bar playing D&D... Nothing wrong with the place but quite pricey and not my scene
53.351070	-6.282360	Tommy O'Garas	Had everything going for it.... Except the fuckin Boez jersey on the wall. Nice bar. Meant to be a good trad sesh in the place as well but there was no music when we were there. 
53.348830	-6.278540	Oscars	I feel harsh saying this because there was nothing really bad about the place but it's everything that's wrong with modern trendy pubs. The staff are pretty useless, the drink is expensive(ish), it feels more like a restaurant by asking you to wait for a table (there were like 3 fuckin occupied tables when we were in). Decor was shite as well. Oh and they refuse tracksuits, I always find that a bit snobby too.
53.347620	-6.280170	Token	One of the most interesting non-local type pubs that I've been too. We made a little effort to get here seeing as the pub is closing down. The place was filled with arcard games and pinball machines. Decent selection of beers as well (although the Ambush was out... arrrggghhhhh). Kev kicked my ass in Street Fighter. He picked Ken. He always fuckin picks Ken. Anyways, enjoyable as something different. Sad to see it shutting down.
